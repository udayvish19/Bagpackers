        <h1 class="location">Ladakh</h1>
        <p class="info">Ladakh is a region administered by India as a union territory and constitutes an eastern portion of the larger Kashmir region
             that has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan since 1947 and India and China since 1959.
              Ladakh is bordered by the Tibet Autonomous Region to the east, the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh to the south,
               both the Indian-administered union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan to the west,
                and the southwest corner of Xinjiang across the Karakoram Pass in the far north.
                 It extends from the Siachen Glacier in the Karakoram range to the north to the main Great Himalayas to the south. The eastern end,
             consisting of the uninhabited Aksai Chin plains, is claimed by the Indian Government as part of Ladakh, but has been under Chinese control.</p>
        <p class="info">In the past, Ladakh gained importance from its strategic location at the crossroads of important trade routes,
             but as Chinese authorities closed the borders between Tibet Autonomous Region and Ladakh in the 1960s, international trade dwindled.
              Since 1974, the Government of India has successfully encouraged tourism in Ladakh.
             As Ladakh is strategically important, the Indian military maintains a strong presence in the region.</p>
        <p class="info">The largest town in Ladakh is Leh, followed by Kargil, each of which headquarters a district.
             The Leh district contains the Indus, Shyok and Nubra river valleys. The Kargil district contains the Suru, Dras and Zanskar river valleys.
              The main populated regions are the river valleys, but the mountain slopes also support pastoral Changpa nomads. The main religious groups
               in the region are Muslims (mainly Shia) (46%), Buddhists (mainly Tibetan Buddhists) (40%), and Hindus (12%) with the remaining 2% made of other religions.
             Ladakh is one of the most sparsely populated regions in India. Its culture and history are closely related to those of Tibet.</p>
        <p class="info">Ladakh was established as a union territory of India on 31 October 2019, following the passage of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act.
             Prior to that, it was part of the Jammu and Kashmir state.
             Ladakh is both the largest and the second least populous union territory of India.</p>  
          
             <h3 class="mod"> Names and their etymology </h3>

            <p class="info">The classical name in Tibetan: ལ་དྭགས, Wylie: La dwags, THL: la dak means the "land of high passes". 
                Ladak is its pronunciation in several Tibetan dialects. The English spelling Ladakh is derived from Persian: ladāx.<br><br>
                The region was previously known as Maryul (see page for etymology).</p>
            <p class="info"> Medieval Islamic scholars called Ladakh the "Great Tibet" (derived from Turko-Arabic Ti-bat, meaning "highland");
                 Baltistan and other trans-Himalayan states in Kashmir's vicinity were referred to as "Little Tibets".</p>
            <p class="info">It has also been called Ma-Lo-Pho (by Hiuen Tsang) or Lal Bhumi.
                 Names in the local language include Kanchapa (Land of snow) and Ripul (Country of mountains).</p>

            <h3 class="history">Ladakh Division </h3>
            
            <p class="info"> On 8 February 2019, Ladakh became a separate Revenue and Administrative Division within Jammu and Kashmir, 
                having previously been part of the Kashmir Division. 
                As a division, Ladakh was granted its own Divisional Commissioner and Inspector General of Police.</p>
            <p class="info"> Leh was initially chosen to be the headquarters of the new division however, following protests,
                 it was announced that Leh and Kargil will jointly serve as the divisional headquarters, 
                 each hosting an Additional Divisional Commissioner to assist the Divisional Commissioner and Inspector General of Police who will spend half their time in each town.</p>
            
            
            <h3 class="mod"><br> Administration </h3>
            <p class="info">
                Under the terms of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, Ladakh is administered as a union territory without a legislative assembly or elected government. 
                The head of government is a Lieutenant Governor appointed by the President of India who is assisted by civil servants of the Indian Administrative Service</p>
            
            <p class="sum"> In summary, Ladakh, often called "The Land of High Passes," is a mesmerizing region in northern India known for its rugged terrain,
                 stunning landscapes, and unique culture. Nestled in the Indian Himalayas, it offers breathtaking views of snow-capped mountains, crystal-clear lakes,
                  and ancient monasteries. Adventure enthusiasts flock to Ladakh for its high-altitude trekking, thrilling motorcycle journeys,
                   and serene experiences at places like Pangong Lake and Nubra Valley. With its blend of Tibetan Buddhism, colorful festivals,
                 and warm hospitality, Ladakh provides an unforgettable journey into one of the world's most remote and enchanting destinations.</p>
