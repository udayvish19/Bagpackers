        <h1 class="location">Mehrangarh Fort</h1>
        <p class="info">Mehrangarh is a historic fort located in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. 
            It stands on a hilltop, rising about 122 m (400 ft) above the surrounding plains,and the complex spans 1,200 acres (486 hectares).
             It was initially built around 1459 by the Rajput ruler of Rathore clan Rao Jodha,
              though most of the existing structure is from the 17th century built by his successors.
              The fort has seven gates, which includes main entrance Jai Pol (meaning 'victory gate'),
               built by Maharaja Man Singh to commemorate his victories over the Jaipur and Bikaner armies in 1806. 
            The Fattehpol, commemorates victory of Maharaja Ajit Singh over the Mughals.</p>
        <p class="info">Within its boundaries, you'll find several palaces known for their intricate carvings and expansive courtyards, a Chamunda Mataji Temple, 
            as well as a museum that houses various relics. A winding road leads to and from the city below. The imprints of the impact of cannonballs 
            fired by attacking armies of Jaipur can still be seen on the second gate.
             At the north-east of the fort is the chhatri of Kirat Singh Sodha, a soldier who fell on the spot defending Mehrangarh.</p>
        <p class="info">Some of the notable festivals taking place here include the World Sacred Spirit Festival and Rajasthan International Folk Festival.</p>

                The fort was named Mihirgarh, meaning ‘fort of the sun’ – a reference to the ruling clan Rathore's mythical descent from the sun god Surya</p>
